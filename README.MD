## React Dependencies Graph
Map out your react dependencies

## How does it work?
Input the path to the folder which contains your `components` and `containers`
folders.
```
app/
  javascripts/
    components/
    containers/
```

For example, the path you would input for the structure above would be `app/javascripts`
